### You've found ThÃ©o ðŸ‘‹

âš¡ Fun facts:
- I use the fish shell. Some people seem to find it funny.
- I have a custom program running on one of my Raspberry Pi home servers observing the `/proc/mounts` file and re-mounting manually an external USB drive as soon as it's unmounted. This has to do with some USB related weirdness on the Raspberry Pi side that leads to an external USB hard drive to somewhat block the system from booting if you add it to the `/etc/fstab`. If you have ideas, or a nicer solution for me, SEND HELP.
