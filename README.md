### Fun facts ‚ö°

- I use the fish shell. Some people seem to find it funny.
- I have a custom program running on one of my Raspberry Pi home servers observing the `/proc/mounts` file and manually re-mounting an external USB drive as soon as it's unmounted. This has to do with some USB-related weirdness on the Raspberry Pi side that leads to an external USB hard drive to somewhat block the system from booting if you add it to the `/etc/fstab`. If you have ideas or a more excellent solution for me, SEND HELP.
