⚡ Fun facts

- I use the fish shell. Some people seem to find it funny.
- I use the MonaLisa font for everything that's remotely related to code, and people have been calling me "so french 🇫🇷" for it.
- I have an obsession with hardcore management and simulation games. If both the pilots of an Airbus A320 I was onboard were to become incapacitated, I'd probably be the passengers' best chance at landing it safely.
